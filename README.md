# Amayadori

Amayadori (雨宿り) is a small chat demo. The original prototype checked your local weather and relied on Firebase, but this simplified version skips those features. When you open the page you can immediately chat with a built-in bot.

## Running the prototype

1. Download or clone this repository and open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Start chatting – no API keys or configuration are required.
